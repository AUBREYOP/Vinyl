# Vinyl
ðŸ“€ An all-in-one JVM Malware analysis tool.
 
âœ¨ Vinyl is a CLI toolkit offering features for analysing JVM malware. Some features we're aiming to include are:
## ðŸ“€ Features

- A lovely CLI interface.
- Several tools for analysis, debugging and more.
- Working with Java 17+ Flawlessly!
- Tons of commands with a lot of documentation!


## ðŸ“€ Roadmap

- Attempt to add modules that bypass security measures (obfusucation, anti-debugging etc..)
- Easy to understand documentation
- Dynamic Agents that work on Java 21+ without requiring certain Java args


## Acknowledgements

This project is just for me to learn more about JVM internals and reverse engineering, so don't expect it to be amazing lmao :p
